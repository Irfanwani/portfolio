      As an Integration Manager, I lead the efforts to connect our core platform
      with a variety of third-party systems, including CRMs, ATSs, and other
      business tools. I oversee the full lifecycle of integrations—from planning
      and development to deployment and maintenance—ensuring seamless data flow
      and reliability. My responsibilities include designing and maintaining
      robust APIs, implementing webhooks and SDKs, and supporting external teams
      in integrating with our platform. I also work closely with internal
      stakeholders to identify integration needs, optimize existing connections,
      and enhance the overall user experience. In addition to integrations, I
      manage mobile application development, contribute to backend systems, and
      help shape the future of our integration architecture.
